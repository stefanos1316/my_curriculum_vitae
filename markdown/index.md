Technical Experience
--------------------
*Back-End*
:   BASH (Often automating cumbersome and time consuming tasks)
:   NodeJS (Fan of KOA, prefer Mocha-Chai, like to use Native Addons for performance)
:   Java (Was also teaching it at the Athens University of Economics and Business)
:   Python (No need to read tutorials, feeling confy to code anytime)
:   C (First language to learn and impressed by its performance)
:   C++ (Second to learn, but as soon as I learned Java I stopped using it)
:   MongoDB ([Basics](mongodb_m001,pdf), [Aggregations](mongodb_m121.pdf), [JavaScript](mongodb_m220.pdf), and [Performance](mongodb_m201.pdf))

*DevOps*
:   Continuous Integration and Deployment (Big fan of CI/CD Travis, GitLab, and Actions)
:   Code Quality (Coveralls, maven-plugins, Style-Checkers, Reports, and pre-commit hooks)
:   Hosting (Firbase, Docker, and Google App Engine)
:   Mobile CI/CD (Bitrise with Cordova wrapper for mobile apps)
:   Configuration Management (Ansible because it uses YAML)

*Projects*
:   Epidose: A privacy-preserving epidemic dosimeter based on contact tracing [Repository](https://github.com/eellak/epidose)
:   Exam Questionnaire Scanner: [Repository](https://github.com/AntonisGkortzis/ExamQuestionnaireScanner)
