	abstract = {Most modern information technology devices use the Internet for creating, reading, updating, and deleting shared data through remote inter-process communication (ipc). To evaluate the energy consumption of ipc technologies and the corresponding run-time performance implications, we performed an empirical study on popular ipc systems implemented in Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, php, Ruby, and C\#. We performed our experiments on computer platforms equipped with Intel and arm processors. We observed that JavaScript and Go implementations of grpcoffer the lowest energy consumption and execution time. Furthermore, by analysing their system call traces, we found that inefficient use of system calls can contribute to increased energy consumption and poor execution time.},
